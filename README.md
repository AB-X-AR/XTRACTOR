# **XTRACTOR**
XTRACTOR is a fast, pluggable, and vulnerability-focused scanner built to extract exploitable HTML, JS, and CSS terms across web domains. Designed for bug bounty recon, red teaming, and offensive security automation.

## **Why XTRACTOR?**
- Web applications expose clues through their markup ‚Äî things like <script>, onerror, or target="_blank" can signal real risks.

- XTRACTOR automates the detection and classification of these indicators, allowing ethical hackers to focus on chaining attack vectors instead of manually reviewing source code.

## **Key Capabilities**
- üîç Scans single or multiple domains

- üß† Links each found term to its possible vulnerability type

- üõ° Detects missing headers like Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options

- üé® Color-coded terminal output with optional file report

- üß© Easily extensible for other languages or frameworks
